# Small-Database-Design
This repository contains a project I did with some other colleagues at Uni in which we designed a database from scratch which contains data about professional teams, players, and match-ups between teams.

The project is in Romanian, and the files are:

- Diagrama_BD.drawio: draw.io file for the diagram of the database.
- Diagrama_BD.png: a photo of the same diagram.
- Explicatii design BD: an explanation for the structure and creation of the database, in Romanian.
- script_final.sql: complete SQL script for the database.
